std-nslog is a shim that redirects stderr/stdout to the Apple System Log
(NSLog). This can be useful when deploying Python code as a standalone
app on macOS or iOS.

## Usage

std-nslog primary exists as a utility for briefcase deployments. You
shouldn't ever need to install it yourself. However, just in case...

To install std-nslog:

    $ pip install std-nslog

Then, in your code, `import nslog`. This will install the shim. The file
only needs to be imported once; preferably as early as possible in the

Once installed, all output written to stdout and stderr will be
redirected to the Apple System Log.

## Why no pun?

While an obscure joke referencing apples and logs might be amusing, it
would make no sense when it appeared in a Briefcase requirements file.
